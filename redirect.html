<p> Hey Fun Fact: You didn't have to answer any of those questions, you could have just clicked on next! Now I have some of your information. We're so used to giving out our information on the internet that we don't think twice about it. Privacy is a huge concern in technology today. We should be careful with who sees our posts and what we share on the internet.  </p>
